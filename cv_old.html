							Mentors: Adrián Csiszárik, Dániel Varga, Pál Zsámboki
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Enhancing the minimum count of edges within the unit distance graph involving n points on a plane, while gaining deeper insights into the unsolved problem originally proposed by Paul Erdős in 1946.</li>
								<li>Implementing tree search and beam search algorithms to identify potential unit distance graphs, with the goal of achieving an improved lower bound on edge count. Utilizing multi-processor and GPU implementations to enhance the efficiency of the search algorithms.</li>
								<li>Testing conjectures, including constructing unit distance graphs from the Moser Lattice and Moser Ring using generating rules like rotation, translation, and reflection, and providing mathematical proofs for theorems.</li>
							</ul>


							
							<h3>Research Assistant (May 2022 - Apr. 2023)</h3>
							<p>Computer Science Department, Colby College, Waterville, Maine<br/> 
								Project: Generative Emotive Sounds for Robots
								<br/>Project link: <a href="https://github.com/ysu24/HRI-Non-Linguistic-Utterances" target="_blank">https://github.com/ysu24/HRI-Non-Linguistic-Utterances</a> 
								| C++, Python, Linux<br/>
								Mentor: Professor Hannen Wolfe
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Implemented a vision processor, a non-linguistic utterance sound player, and controlled robotic motions on the DARwIn-OP robot, enhancing its sensing capabilities and interactive behaviors.</li>
								<li>Developed sophisticated Python scripts to automatically generate a variety of emotive non-linguistic utterance sound clips, adding a crucial layer of emotional depth to the project's audio aspect.</li>
								<li>Conducted user study experiments to explore the perception of non-linguistic utterances produced by the robot.</li>
								<li>Performed repeated measures ANOVA on the experimental data to investigate the potential relationship between our non-linguistic utterance sounds and emotions. Additionally, conducted sentiment analysis on the collected adjectives during the experiment to gain further insights.</li>
